# angular-app-localhost


## Description
This project was created to pimp your localhost. You probably know the wamp interface, which lists the projects you have in your root `www` directory.

By putting this little app in the `www` directory you get:

* A list of all projects.
* Search functionality in the project list.
* A readme displayed for each project.
* Agile workload calculator (fibonacci weight caculation).
* A console to quickly write and execute PHP.


## Installation

Simply place the app folder at the root of the root `www` directory of your local environment.


### Project list

The project list displays the list of everything in your root directory.
If a favicon is available it will be used, otherwise a default favicon will be used.
